# Load The Dataset
blackf_data <- fread("sales.csv")

# STEP 1: DATA PROFILING

# Basic Statistics: The following questions will be explored:

    # A. What is the size of the dataset?
object.size(blackf_data) # The data size is 37.6 MB

    # B. How many rows and columns are there in the dataset?
dim(blackf_data) # 550068 rows and 12 columns

    # C. What does my dataset look like?
head(blackf_data, 10)
# From the first 10 rows it is evident that, the same user ID is repeated the number of times purchases were made
# The Age variable is reported as a range of values
#There are 3 city categories namely A, B, & C
# The stay in current ranges from 1 - 4 years
# The customers comprised of both married (1) and singles (0)
# There are 3 different product categories available to customers

    # D. What is the structure of the data?
str(blackf_data) # Text
plot_str(blackf_data) # Network Graph
# The dataset are made up of factors and integers
# Marital status should probably be a factor and not an integer, hence, it must be converted
# Purchase, age, and Stay in current city should be numeric
# Product ID, gender should be a factor

    # E. Are there any missing values?
sapply(blackf_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
plot_missing(blackf_data)

    # F. What is the data distribution? i.e. what are the continous and discrete features?
# Continous Features
  #Did the married visited the store more?
prop.table(table(blackf_data$Marital_Status))
plot_histogram(blackf_data)

# Discrete Features

  # How many male and female customers?
prop.table(table(blackf_data$Gender))
  # Customers age group
prop.table(table(blackf_data$Age))
  # Which city category has the highest customers?
prop.table(table(blackf_data$City_Category))
  # What effect does the duration of stay in current has on the store visit?
prop.table(table(blackf_data$Stay_In_Current_City_Years))

# Transform the data types

# STEP 3: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

# CONCLUSION

# 1. THERE WERE MORE MALES (75%) CUSTOMERS THAN FEMALES (25%)

# 2. THE 3 MAJOR CUSTOMERS CLASSIFIED UNDER THE AGE GROUP VARIABLE ARE
      # A. 26-35 YEARS OLD --- 40%
      # B. 36-45 YEARS OLD --- 20%
      # C. 18-25 YEARS OLD --- 18%
    # THE LEAST WAS THE 0 -17 YEARS OLD WITH JUST 3%, FOLLOWING THAT CLOSELY WAS THE 55+ WITH 4%, 
    # THE 46-50 AND 51-55 WERE CLOSELY MATCHED WITH 8% AND 7% RESPECTIVELY

# 3. CITY CATEGORY B HAD THE MOST CUSTOMERS(42%), FOLLOWED BY C (31%), AND LASTLY A (27%)

# 4. pEOPLE WHO HAD STAYED IN THE CITY FOR 1 YEAR CONSTITUTED MAJORITY OF THE CUSTOMERS

# 5. sINGLES MADE UP 59 % WHILE MARRIED MADE UP 41% OF THE CUSTOMERS

# 6. MORE MALES THAN FEMALES PURCHASED ALL 3 PRODUCT CATEGORIES, ALTHOUGH FOR THE 0-17 YEARS OLD, IT WAS CLOSELY MATCHED

# 7. AS EXPECTED 26-35 YEAR OLDS SPENT MORE MONEY

# 8. IN ALL THE CITY CATEGORIES, THE SINGLES SPENT THE MOST MONEY

# 9. FOR THE PRODUCT CATEGORIES WITH THE HIGHEST PURCHASE, THE PLOTS PRESENT THEM IN DETAILS
