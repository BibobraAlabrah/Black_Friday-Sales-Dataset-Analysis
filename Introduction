# Black_Friday-Sales-Dataset-Analysis
A retail company wants to understand the purchase behavior of its customers during Black Friday sales to create personalized offers/deals.  This project provided actionable insights to assist key business decisions. R programming was used as the software package for carrying out statistical analysis and data visualization.

This analysis provided the company with insights such as their customers' age group distribution and preferred products, the age group that made the most purchases, the city (branch) that sold the most products by categories. 

Recommendations were made based on these insights to help the company to make informed business decisions.
